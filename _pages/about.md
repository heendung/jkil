I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe Research</a>. I have broad interests in **Vision and Language**. Recently, I have focused on multimodal foundation models and agents. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University, where I was fortunate to work with [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/). Before joining Adobe Research, I interned at <a href="https://research.google">Google Research</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/publications">Amazon Alexa AI</a>.
